## `org.int4.common.collection.ShiftList`

`ShiftList` is a high-performance, general-purpose `List` and `Deque` implementation optimized for
use cases where frequent insertions and removals occur near the head or tail of the list. It combines
the performance benefits of block-based storage with a rotating offset mechanism to avoid costly
element shifts typical of `ArrayList`.

### Why `ShiftList`?

Standard Java collections like `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` trade off insertion/removal speed,
memory locality, and access time:

- `ArrayList` provides fast indexed access but performs progressively worse when inserting or removing elements
  further from the end, due to the need to shift elements.

- `LinkedList` allows efficient insertions/removals at both ends but has poor cache performance and slow random access.

- `ShiftList` is designed to support fast insertions and removals at any index (especially at the head and tail)
  while maintaining random access performance comparable to `ArrayList`.

### Key Design Concepts

- **Block-based storage**: The list is internally divided into fixed-size blocks within a contiguous array.
  Block size is dynamically determined based on capacity, and tuned for optimal performance.

- **Block rotation**: Instead of shifting elements on every insert/remove, blocks are rotated, with only overflow
  elements moved between them. This make structural modifications proportional to the number of affected blocks,
  not the total element count.

- **Global rotation**: A global rotation offset enables fast modifications near the list's start, effectively
  halving the number of affected blocks. Operations near the head or tail are close to `O(1)`, while those nearer
  to the middle degrade gradually to `O(blockSize)`.

### Benchmark Summary

All benchmarks were performed using [JMH](https://github.com/openjdk/jmh). For raw data see the [benchmarks](https://github.com/int4-org/Common/tree/master/common-collection/benchmarks) folder.
The lists compared are JDK's `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, and Apache Commons Collections' `TreeList`.

#### Insertions and removals

Measurements were done performing exactly 10,000 operations per iteration. For smaller lists, several
lists were used to not exceed `0.5 * size` elements added per list. The resuls are in nano seconds per
element. Bolded results are fastest or within 10% of fastest.

### Time complexity

| Operation              | ShiftList | ArrayList | LinkedList | TreeList  |
|------------------------|:---------:|:---------:|:----------:|:---------:|
| Add/remove at tail     | `O(1)`    | `O(1)`    | `O(1)`    | `O(log n)` |
| Add/remove at head     | `O(1)`    | `O(n)`    | `O(1)`    | `O(log n)` |
| Random access          | `O(1)`    | `O(1)`    | `O(n)`    | `O(log n)` |
| Add/remove at index    | `O(n/b)`  | `O(n)`    | `O(n)`    | `O(log n)` |

> Where `n` is the number of elements the list holds, and `b` is the block size of `ShiftList`

`ShiftList` provides performance close to `ArrayList` for the common `get(int)` operation due to minimal
indirection when locating an element. In contrast, `LinkedList` and `TreeList` require pointer traversal,
which incurs higher actual latency than their asymptotic complexity suggests.

| Feature                  | ShiftList | ArrayList | LinkedList | TreeList  |
|--------------------------|:---------:|:---------:|:----------:|:---------:|
| Memory locality          | ++        | ++        | --         | --        |
| Estimated memory/element | 4-8 bytes | 4-6 bytes | ~24 bytes  | ~32 bytes |

`LinkedList` and `TreeList` allocate a wrapper object per element, leading to high memory overhead
and poor memory locality due to non-contiguous storage. `ShiftList` stores elements in contiguous
blocks, improving cache performance. Its capacity is always a power of two, and in the worst case
(50% utilization), memory usage is approximately 8 bytes per element. By contrast, `ArrayList`
typically grows by 50% when resizing and can trim to fit, leading to more compact memory usage when
fully utilized.

### Limitations

- `ShiftList` has a minimum capacity of 16 elements
- `ShiftList` has a maximum capacity of 2^30 - 65536 elements (this is due to the restriction that
  its storage array must be a power of 2 in size, and that its first and last element can't be in
  the same block.)
